# Plonky3 Python Notebook

The Plonky3 Python Notebook is an educational resource designed to demystify the inner workings of the Plonky3 proof system. By leveraging interactive Python notebooks, this project provides a hands-on approach to understanding the technical principles behind Plonky3, making advanced zero-knowledge (ZK) technology more accessible to developers and enthusiasts.

## Overview

[Plonky3](https://github.com/Plonky3/Plonky3) is a modular toolkit developed by Polygon for building succinct proof systems, such as PLONK and STARKs. It enables developers to create customized zkVMs and zkEVMs tailored to specific use cases, optimizing for speed, proof size, and other performance metrics.

The Plonky3 Python Notebook aims to:

- **Educate**: Provide comprehensive explanations of the core concepts and components of the Plonky3 proof system.

- **Demonstrate**: Offer interactive code examples that illustrate how Plonky3 operates under the hood.

- **Empower**: Equip developers with the knowledge to implement and utilize Plonky3 in their own projects.

## Features

- **Interactive Learning**: Utilizes Jupyter Notebooks to combine explanatory text, live code, and visualizations, facilitating an engaging learning experience.

- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Covers various aspects of Plonky3, including polynomial commitment schemes, field arithmetic, and proof generation.

## Getting Started

### Run on Local

To begin exploring the Plonky3 Python Notebook:

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
