    "## How FRI works\n",
    "A FRI protocol is a protocol for proving that a function $f : H \\to \\mathbb{F}$ is closed to a polynomial of low degree $d$, where $d \\ll |H|$. \n",
    "The FRI PCS outputs the root of the Merkle tree as the commitment to the function $f$ while the FRI protocol consists of the evaluation proof.\n",
    "The protocol can be divided into two phases: commit and query.\n",
    "In the commit phash, the prover commits to (via Merkle trees) a series of functions generated from $f$ and random elements $v_0, v_1, ... $ from $\\mathbb{K}$ provided by the verifier at each round. \n",
    "Then in the query phase, the prover provides a set of evaluations of the previously committed functions at a point randomly chosen by the verifier."

    "### Commit Phase\n",
    "Denote by $p_0$ the function of low degree. \n",
    "In the commit phase, the polynomial $p_0$ is split into two polynomials $g_{0,1}, g_{0,2} : H^2 \\to \\mathbb{K}$ of degree lower than $d/2$ such that:\n",
    "$$p_0(X) = g_{0,1}(X^2) + X g_{0,2}(X^2).$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, the verifier sends a uniform randomness $v_0 \\in \\mathbb{K}$ and ask the prover to commit to the polynomial: $p_1(X) = g_{0,1}(X) + v_0 g_{0,2}(X)$.\n",
    "Note that $p_1$ is a polynomial of degree less than $d/2$ and the commitment of $p_1$ is not over $H$ but over $H^2 = \\{x^2 : x \\in H \\}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The prover then continues by splitting $p_1$ into $g_{1,1}$ and $g_{1,2}$ of degree lower than $d/4$, and constructs $p_2$ with a uniformly sampled $v_1 \\in \\mathbf{K}$ sent by the verifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "This above interaction iterates $k = \\log d$ times.\n",
    "At last, $deg(p_k) = 0$ and the prover sends a constant $p_k$, representing a polynomial of degree lower than 1, to the verifier. "

    "### Query Phase\n",
    "In the query phase, the verifier sends a randomness $r \\in H$ to the prover and queries the evaluations $p_0(r), p_0(-r)$ and $p_1(r_2)$.\n",
    "From $p_0(r), p_0(-r)$ the verifier computes $p_1(r^2)$ and checks that the computed value matches $p_1(r^2)$ sent by the prover.\n",
    "In detail, $p_1(r^2)$ can be obtained as follows:\n",
    "- $p_0(r) = g_{0,1}(r^2) + r\\cdot g_{0,2}(r^2)$;\n",
    "- $p_0(-r) = g_{0,1}(r^2) - r\\cdot g_{0,2}(r^2)$;\n",
    "- $p_1(r^2) = g_{0,1}(r^2) + v_0\\cdot g_{0,2}(r^2)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next interaction, the verifier queries $p_1(-r^2)$ and $p_2(r^4)$ and checks the consistency between $p_1, p_2$ as before.\n",
    "The interaction repeats till the constant $p_k$. \n",
    "The verifier checks that the value sent by the prover is indeed equal to the value that the verifier computed from the queries up until $p_{k-1}$.\n",
    "To fully ensure correctness, the prover must accompany the evaluations that she sends with a claim of their existence (via Merkle tree paths).\n",
    "Upon the completion of this process, the verifier has a first confirmation that the polynomials committed in the commit phase $p_0, p_1, . . . , p_k$ are consistent with each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, to achieve the required bounds for the soundness of the protocol, the query phase is repeated multiple times."
